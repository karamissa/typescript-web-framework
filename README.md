# typescript-web-framework

This is a project that I've did to learn Typescript and become more proficient in it. It's a framework inspired by old ones like Backbone.

It handles data and sync with an outside source to save the data. It renders HTML elements and reactively updates them when there's a change in the data.

A user class with some user specific view examples are included.
